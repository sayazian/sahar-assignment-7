This assignment will focus on algorithms, specifically around coding your own implementation of the ArrayList data structure.

Note: No cheating and looking at Java’s source code to see how they solved it!

Your task is to implement all the abstract methods in the CustomList interface via the CustomArrayList class.

While you’re implementing code inside of the CustomArrayList class, you should test it inside of a CustomListApplication class with a main method.

Please make sure you try adding more than 10 elements to your CustomList.
